                Come on, let's go and play!<br>
                I never see you anymore<br>
                Come out the door<br>
                It's like you've gone away
            </p>

            <p>
                We used to be best buddies<br>
                And now we're not<br>
                I wish you would tell me <em>whyyyyyyyy!</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Do you want to build a snowman?<br>
                It doesn't have to be a snowman<br>
            </p>

            <strong><span>Go away, Anna!</span></strong>

                Do you want to build a snowman?<br>
                Or ride our bike around the halls?<br>
                I think some company is overdue<br>
                I've started talking to<br>
                The pictures on the walls!
            </p>

            <p>
                It gets a little lonely<br>
                All these empty rooms<br>
                Just watching the hours tick by
            </p>
